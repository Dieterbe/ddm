DDM is a bash script that manages your data, distributed over multiple
(*nix) systems. You tell it how you want to work with your data and ddm will
do the copying, deleting, syncing, committing, updating, ... for you.
It uses simple things like cp, rsync and svn for this.
Configuration is done through simple text files that will be sourced.

Ddm works with repositories: these are data stores on your server which
should never be edited by hand. A repository can be a svn repository or
something as simple as a directory shared over the network ( through NFS,
SMB, ... )

I highly recommend autoFS as auto mounter. It is very easy, yet powerful and
flexible.
