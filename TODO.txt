= 0.4 =
 * implement basic blob datatype that is rsync --delete -au (for now).
 * if selection system doesn't work very well, fall back to "rm and copy again" for now. improvements can come later.
 * doublecheck that directory naming with dataset type suffix is recommended but not necessary (a must for cache datasets)
 * make sure ddm behaves like docs say, or edit docs.
 * be compatible with xdg userdirectories (may work already, convert ~ and see if it still works)

 * implement flush for buffer
 * fix all actions/aliases


= 0.5 =
 * fix get_exaile plugin
 * better documentation for helper functions and plugins like slidewindow, get_exaile etc (how they work, extendability, where to store, etc)
 * fix getopts so that 'ddm -a update -p -v .mozilla' (forgot -d) is spotted, and also stuff like -.mozilla or -mozilla should be spotted
 * 'wrap_rsync --delete? question' -> non-interactive rsyncing / commandline rsync parameter specifying? 
   important that we can do it sometimes and sometimes not, but not interactive please!


= Someday =
 * implement backup action for extension
 * port to ... php? python?
 * ddmrc. now: shell code that gets sourced. someday: ini config file
 * ignore variables in a good format so that they can always be used by bash/rsync/svn/...
 * generic, inheritable functions to find "consumed" files (based on bash history, media player recent files file, ...). 
 * improve blob dataset type to not just rsync but make space efficient snapshots (and you must be able to choose a specific snapshot)
   Options (must still be reviewed and decided) :
   - git           git has a pretty efficient storage system, although it doesn't store owner/group, permissions, xattrs etc
     could help:
     * metastore     http://david.hardeman.nu/software.php#metastore

 * better documentation for datasets: which are defined for which repository types? ( a table would be useful)
 * better documentation for actions: what does each action do by default for each dataset type? ( a table would be useful)


= Undecided =


= Ideas =
 * datasets that are multiple dataset types for different repo's (would this be useful?)
 * repositories that are a dataset for another repository (would this be useful?)
