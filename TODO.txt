 * good XDG basedir support
 * implement basic blob datatype that is rsync --delete -au (for now).
 * if selection system doesn't work very well, fall back to "rm and copy again" for now. improvements can come later.
 * doublecheck that directory naming with dataset type suffix is recommended but not necessary (a must for cache datasets)
 * do i want users to define their own dataset types? probably not? then i probably dont want them to invent actions either?
   -> users should be able to define their own actions, but they must set ALLOWED_ACTIONS in ddmrc to prevent themselves from making typo's
 * users can unset actions if they dont like them right? with unset. this is good?
 * implement backup action for extension
 * make sure ddm behaves like docs say, or edit docs.
 * write Changelog
 * be compatible with xdg userdirectories (may work already, convert ~ and see if it still works)
   http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs
 * implement flush for buffer
 * better documentation for helper functions and plugins like slidewindow, get_exaile etc (how they work, extendability, where to store, etc)
 * fix all actions/aliases
 * instead of defining the many functions as just 'true', maybe don't set them at all and figure out how to play safe. users can unset anyway
 * add in docs: which datasets are not defined for which repository types. maybe in a table...
 * also show in a table in docs which actions apply on which datasets (by default)

Someday:
 * port to ... php? python?
 * ddmrc from shell code that gets sourced to ini config file
 * ignore variables in a good format so that they can always be used by bash/rsync/svn/...
 * generic, inheritable functions to find "consumed" files (based on bash history, media player recent files file, ...). 
 * improve blob dataset type to not just rsync but make space efficient snapshots (and you must be able to choose a specific snapshot)
   Options (must still be reviewed and decided) :
   - git           git has a pretty efficient storage system, although it doesn't store owner/group, permissions, xattrs etc
     could help:

Ideas:
 * datasets that are multiple dataset types for different repo's (would this be useful?)
 * repositories that are a dataset for another repository (would this be useful?)
